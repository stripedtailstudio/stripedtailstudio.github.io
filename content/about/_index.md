It started with a red panda sticker. 

We had been taking annual trips to the California north coast to hike in the redwood forest and visit the Sequioa Park Zoo in Eureka, CA. Wishing there were more red panda souvenirs at the zoo, we decided to design our own and pitch it to the gift shop. Surprisingly, we received a response!

A few weeks and several more animal illustrations later, we had our first order. The stickers proved popular, so we're creating more.

We love clean design and would like to spread the joy of custom souvenirs with a modern aesthetic.
